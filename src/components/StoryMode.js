import React from 'react';

const StoryMode = () => {
    return (
        <div className="story-mode">
            <h1>Welcome to Story Mode!</h1>
            <h2>Want to do a legend run playthrough? This is the place for you!</h2>
            <p>This actually won't be this simple. I'll put the StoryModeContainer here. 
                And hey look. It's another container component. Might not even need to filter 
                by manufacturer or type after all. At least not to meet the requirements. 
                Which is a good place to start and then build up from. Anyways Story Mode, coming soon!
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}

export default StoryMode;
